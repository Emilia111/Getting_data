##Study Design
The data was collected from 
##Code Book
With this script two different datasets are created. One of them is also written in a txt file called dataset2.txt.
Althouth they have some features in common let me explain them separately.
### 1st data set
In step 4 of the instructions a tidy data set is asked. This has been built as a data frame called dataset1 in the script.
It contains the following columns:
* Activities: The measurement have been performed over five different activities. In this column I include, for each measurement, the name of the activity.
* Subject: In the experiment 30 people participate. In this column it is sayd who of this 30 people carries the device to perform the measurement (each person is labelled with a number)
* Mean Body Accel X: For each measurement, the X component of the vector of the body acceleration mean is included.
* Mean Body Accel Y: For each measurement, the Y component of the vector of the body acceleration mean is included.
* Mean Body Accel Z: For each measurement, the Z component of the vector of the body acceleration mean is included.
* Stand Body Accel X: For each measurement, the X component of the vector of the body acceleration standard deviation is included.
* Stand Body Accel Y: For each measurement, the Y component of the vector of the body acceleration standard deviation is included.
* Stand Body Accel Z: For each measurement, the Z component of the vector of the body acceleration standard deviation is included.
* Mean Grav Accel X: For each measurement, the X component of the vector of the gravity acceleration mean is included.
* Mean Grav Accel Y: For each measurement, the Y component of the vector of the gravity acceleration mean is included.
* Mean Grav Accel Z: For each measurement, the Z component of the vector of the gravity acceleration mean is included.
* Stand Grav Accel X: For each measurement, the X component of the vector of the gravity acceleration standard deviation is included.
* Stand Grav Accel Y: For each measurement, the Y component of the vector of the gravity acceleration standard deviation is included.
* Stand Grav Accel Z: For each measurement, the Z component of the vector of the gravity acceleration standard deviation is included.
* Mean Body Ang Vel X: For each measurement, the X component of the vector of the body angular velocity mean is included.
* Mean Body Ang Vel Y: For each measurement, the Y component of the vector of the body angular velocity mean is included.
* Mean Body Ang Vel Z: For each measurement, the Z component of the vector of the body angular velocity mean is included.
* Stand Body Ang Vel X: For each measurement, the X component of the vector of the body angular velocity standard deviation is included.
* Stand Body Ang Vel Y: For each measurement, the Y component of the vector of the body angular velocity standard deviation is included.
* Stand Body Ang Vel Z: For each measurement, the Z component of the vector of the body angular velocity standard deviation is included.
* Mean Body Accel Mag: For each measurement, the magnitude of the vector of the body acceleration mean is included.
* Stand Body Accel Mag: For each measurement, the magnitude of the vector of the body acceleration standard deviation is included.
* Mean Grav Accel Mag: For each measurement, the magnitude of the vector of the gravity acceleration mean is included.
* Stand Grav Accel Mag: For each measurement, the magnitude of the vector of the gravity acceleration standard deviation is included.
* Mean Body Ang Vel Mag: For each measurement, the magnitude of the vector of the body angular velocity mean is included.
* Stand Body Ang Vel Mag: For each measurement, the magnitude of the vector of the body angular velocity standard deviation is included.
